          <p><strong>Death Note</strong> (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsugumi_Ohba">Tsugumi Ohba</a> and illustrated by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Obata">Takeshi Obata</a>. It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006, with its 108 chapters collected in 12 tankōbon volumes. The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him.</p>

After discovering the Death Note and knowing its true powers of killing people after writing a person's name and face in the mind, he decides to use it to rid the world of criminals to make the world a better place. As the series progresses, he develops a God complex as he attempts to become the ruler of the new world he creates. His killings are eventually labelled by people of Japan as the work of "Kira." But after a few days of killing criminals/hostages, "L", the best detective in the world yet an absurd guy, gets the job to find "Kira" and punish him for the murders he is committing.</p>

He takes on the task of tracking down and arresting Kira. His most noticeable characteristic is the fact that he rarely wears shoes. His disheveled appearance and lack of social etiquette causes people to doubt his position as L. He lives in solitude, and only his manager Watari is able to contact him directly. L suspects that Light is Kira almost from the beginning, but is unable confirm his suspicions to others after his death.</p>

        <p class="text_near">Near (ニア, Nia), real name is Nate River, is the young detective who succeeds L after his death. He is the head of an organization created to catch Kira, the SPK (Special Provision for Kira). A placid character with a sharp tongue, he has white hair and wears pale clothes. He constantly plays with toys, building towers of dice and playing cards, and illustrating his exposition with small finger puppets and Lego minifigs. He is seen completing blank puzzles, which emphasizes his problem-solving skills. He was the person who succeeded identifying and capturing Light as Kira. In the anime adaptation, Near is voiced by Noriko Hidaka in Japanese and by Cathy Weseluck in the English version. He is portrayed by Narushi Fukuda in L: Change the World and by Mio Yūki in the television drama.</p>

        <p class="text_mikami">Teru Mikami (魅上 照, Mikami Teru) is a criminal prosecutor, a fanatical supporter of Kira, and the fourth Kira. When Light needs a new Kira proxy to hide his identity, Mikami is selected as the new Kira by Light, purely based on his intuition.[7] Since childhood, Mikami has had a strong sense of justice, but his views have become warped due to years of bullying and trauma.[8] Mikami wishes to punish those he considers to be evil: which, to Light's dismay, includes unproductive people and reformed criminals and worships Kira as a god. Mikami mutters the word "delete" (削除, sakujo) repeatedly to himself while writing in the Death Note.At the end of the series, Mikami is captured by Near's team at the Yellow Box warehouse. While Mikami dies in prison after going insane in the manga, he commits suicide by stabbing himself with his pen in the anime. Matsuda believes that Near wrote in the Death Note to manipulate and restrict Mikami's actions.[9] In the second Death Note rewrite special, Mikami is the one to kill the SPK (after Light blackmails the US president to leak information about the SPK, which he, in turn, forwards to Takada and Mikami), rather than the mafia, as shown in the manga.Mikami makes a cameo appearance in Death Note: Light Up the New World serving as the guardian to Light's young son, Hikari Yagami (夜神光, Yagami Hikari). He murders Hikari in order to steal the boy's notebook but is in turn killed by police officer Tsukuru Mishima. He is portrayed by Kensei Mikami in the film.</p>

        <p class="text_rem">Rem (レム, Remu) is the Shinigami who gives Misa her Death Note. Like Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, Rem did not get hers through trickery. The Shinigami Gelus, who had fallen in love with Misa, intentionally killed someone who was going to murder Misa. Since he had knowingly used his Death Note to extend a human life (a violation of Shinigami law), he was reduced to ash, leaving only his Death Note. Touched by this act, Rem delivered Gelus's Death Note to Misa, since it was her life that he saved. Her appearance is quite skeletal, with long, spinal cord-like arms and bone-like skin.While Ryuk takes amusement in everything in the human world, Rem is almost the exact opposite. She views most humans with contempt, seeing Shinigami as the more evolved race. Also, while Ryuk is ambivalent to Light's success or failure, Rem actively assists Misa, having inherited Gelus's love for her. She is even willing to sacrifice her life to defend Misa, as evidenced by her threat to kill Light should Misa die before her time. For Misa's sake, however, she still assists Light in his schemes, although she despises Kyosuke Higuchi, the human she gave the Death Note to and calls the Yotsuba Group "disgusting creatures" due to them using the Death note for personal gain. Amusingly, Rem experiences difficulty while writing the Japanese language. Light manages to force Rem to work for him by presenting a situation in which harm would come to Misa otherwise. As such, she dies when she writes L's name.</p>
